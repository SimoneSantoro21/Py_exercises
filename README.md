Simple exercises for learning python

Exercise #1 Binomial Distibution:
Sample random numbers from a binomial distribution and compare with distribution function. Show that for for 𝑵→∞ the binomial distribution tends to a Gaussian distribution.

Exercise #2 Rolling a die:
Simulate N rolls of a die. Show the evolution of the histogram of extracted values at each roll. Check that for 𝑵→∞ the probability of finding each face is 1/6. Simulate an unfair die.

Exercise #3 Monte Carlo:
Calculate 𝝅 using the Monte Carlo integration method. How many iterations are needed to get 10 significant digits of 𝝅?

Exercise #4 Monty Hall:
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.
He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Exercise #5 Random walk 1D:
Simulate a random walk in one dimension and plot the results

Exercise #6 Polymer structure 2D:
Simulate a simple polymer in the approximation of non-interacting beads connected by rigid bonds through random walk. Evaluate
mean R and mean R squared.

Exercise #6 Simulation of a projectile on Earth:
Simulate the first 10 seconds of the dynamics of a projectile tossed from a given heigh H, with a given initial velocity v0 = (v0_x, v0_y). (from https://github.com/klyshko/md_python/blob/master/Lecture.ipynb)
